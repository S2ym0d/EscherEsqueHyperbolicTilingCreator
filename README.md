## üöÄ Building the Project

### Clone the Repository, run CMake and compile the solution

git clone https://github.com/S2ym0d/EscherEsqueHyperbolicTilingCreator.git
cd EscherEsqueHyperbolicTilingCreator
mkdir Build
cd Build
cmake ..

Open the generated .sln file in Visual Studio and compile the solution.

The compiled .exe file can be located in the Build/Debug or Build/Release folder.

### Runtime Requirements

Copy the res folder (found inside the resources/ directory) into the same folder as the generated .exe.

The resources folder contains an images folder with some basic images to start with and a tilingSettings.txt file with template for the tiling settings file.

### The program's user guide

The file Escher_esque_Hyperbolic_Tiling_Creator_User_Guide.pdf contains explanation of the idea the project is built on and the user guide for using the program
